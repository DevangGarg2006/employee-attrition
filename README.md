# 🧑‍💼 Employee Attrition Prediction System

A Machine Learning powered web application that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company. This system helps HR teams take proactive, data-driven decisions to reduce employee turnover.

The model is deployed using **Flask** and provides an interactive web interface for real-time predictions and visualization.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Encoding categorical features using `LabelEncoder`
3. Feature selection and splitting into train/test
4. Model training using Logistic Regression / Random Forest
5. Model evaluation using accuracy score
6. Model saved using Joblib
7. Integrated with Flask for real-time prediction

---

## 💻 Features

- Employee data input form
- Real-time attrition prediction
- Clean and responsive UI
- Data visualization using Chart.js
- Easy to deploy locally
